### Usage
When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows or MacOS. Then the user will input a sentence or two describing their problem. The website will try to find an existing article describing a solution to the users problem. If that is not possible the user will be prompted with the decision to contact support by either chat, e-mail or phone.

*When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows, MacOS, Linux or other operating systems. After selecting the appropriate OS, the website will show a table of questions with common problems PC-users may experience. After selecting the suitible question, a new table will show, with further questions fitting for the problem. This system of tables of questions will continue until the program can calculate a relevant solution to the users problem.
