### Usage
When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows or MacOS. Then the user will input a sentence or two describing their problem. The website will try to find an existing article describing a solution to the users problem. If that is not possible the user will be prompted with the decision to contact support by either chat, e-mail or phone.

*When first loading the website, the website will ask the user if he/she is using Windows, MacOS, Linux or other operating systems. After selecting the appropriate OS, the website will show a table of questions with common problems PC-users may experience. After selecting the suitible question, a new table will show, with further questions fitting for the problem. This system of tables of questions will continue until the program can calculate a relevant solution to the users problem.

### Design 
As mentioned in the introduction we have a goal of "creating a diverse and easy-to-use solution, no matter the users experience with computers and computersystems". With this in mind, our designteam had to incorporate designelements, which makes it both easy to use for beginners, and usefull for the professionals.

### Kravspecifikation

#### Userflow:
1. The user should be able to use the website either as a registered user or "guest". The website should be intuitive and easy for the user to use. The user will input his/her problem into the searchbar and will get suggestions on articles that will help the user resolve the problem.

2. The user should be able to log-on to the system and create one or more articles that will describe solutions to common IT problems.

#### Notable functions based on the company/developer needs:
1. The website will use simple software based on word and sentece recognition to find article based on user inputs. It will not use AI or any advanced algorithms as those solutions would be difficult and expensive to implement. 

2. The website will focus on simple design and an ease of use interface.

#### Examples of design


#### Data and database
The website will store limited user information aswell as article information in the database. Articles will regularly be checked on relevens based on creation date and updated/deleted if nessesary. 

#### Administration
The website will have 4 current admins that will administrate the articles and the functionaly of the website. All articles will have to be approved by an admin, before going live on the website. All admins will be overseeing live technical support for the website if the website is experiencing technical difficulties.
